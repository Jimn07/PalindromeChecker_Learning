# PalindromeChecker_Learning

I started to learn JavaScript with HTML & CSS.
I follow 1-2 great playlists on youtube that teaching the basics and advanced concepts.
I decided to practice what i learn by building projects.
Palindrome Checker is a simple & cool project which makes me work with JS, HTML & especially CSS.

What is Palinromic Number ?

--> A palindromic number is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed.

The Project includes :
1. 1 button
2. 1 textbox
3. Checking if textbox contains numbers only.
4. Message Text for the user if the numebr is palindrome or not.


Enjoy!
